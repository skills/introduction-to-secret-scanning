## Step 1: Enable Secret Protection

If you check your email, you probably just got an alert from GitHub with the subject "Possible valid secrets found". Oh no! üòÆ

Don't worry! We put some expired credentials in the exercise on purpose since public repositories get secret protection for free. Nice! üïµÔ∏è

In this step, you will enable secret protection on your repository. After it is enabled, you will add a new credential to see how secret protection identifies the credential and alerts you.

> [!WARNING]
> If your repository is private, you will need [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) to continue. We recommend [changing this exercise repository to public](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility) to enable it.

### What is a secret?

In the our context, a secret (or credential) is a plain-text string, or a pair of strings, that authorizes access a service. Examples could be AWS secret access keys/ID's, Google API keys, or GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs).

The GitHub Docs provides a list of [all supported patterns](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/secret-scanning-patterns#supported-secrets).

### What is secret protection?

Secret protection is a powerful tool which allows teams to identify these plain-text credentials, remove them, and create rules to prevent them from being written to GitHub in the first place.

Secret protection is available **for free for public repositories** on all plans. Enterprises that need secret protection capabilities for private repositories should review [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/security/advanced-security). Not only does it include secret protection, it also provides advanced static analysis, composition, analysis, and enterprise tools to manage your entire AppSec pipeline and reduce your risk profile.

### :keyboard: Activity: Configure secret protection

1. In the header of your repository, open **Settings** in a new browser tab.

1. In the left navigation, under the **Security** section, select **Code Security**.

1. Scroll down past the **Code Scanning** and **Dependabot** sections until you find the **Secret Protection** section.

   > üí° **Tip:** We also have exercises about [code scanning](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-codeql) and [supply chain protection](https://github.com/skills/secure-repository-supply-chain)!

1. Adjust the default configuration to match the below.

   - **Secret Protection:** `enabled`
   - **Push Protection:** `disabled`

### :keyboard: Activity: Commit a sensitive file

Now let's (accidentally) commit a sensitive file to see how it works. Don't worry, these are inactive credentials.

1. In the header of your repository, click the **Code** tab.

1. Above the list of files, click the **Add file** dropdown and select **Create new file**.

   <img width="350" alt="New file button" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f3f8da8-1471-485a-9df5-8c03ecba2d8e"/>

1. Enter the file name `credentials.yml` and copy following **inactive** example credentials into it.

   <img width="400" alt="New file button" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40f5ce62-936c-4d71-8c51-02c724d5aac0"/>

   ```yaml
   default:
     aws_access_key_id: AKIAQYLPMN5HNM4OZ56B
     aws_secret_access_key: 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
     mongodb: mongodb+srv://svc-admin:kLeioeBne5lsopPf@mergington-high.avocado.mongodb.net
     output: json
     region: us-east-2
   ```

1. In the top right, use the **Commit changes...** button to commit directly to the `main` branch.

   > ‚ùóÔ∏è **Important:** Committing to your default branch is not usually a recommended practice. We only do this to simplify the exercise.

1. With our credentials file (accidentally) shared, Mona should quickly notice it and prepare the next step.
