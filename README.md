# Introduction to secret protection

_Learn how to configure secret protection to identify secrets and prevent new ones from being committed to your repository._

## Welcome

Plain-text credentials accidentally stored in repositories on GitHub are a common target for attackers. In fact, we find well over a million tokens stored on the GitHub platform each year. Let's learn how to prevent that!

- **Who is this for**: Developers, DevOps Engineers, security teams.
- **What you'll learn**: How to identify plain-text credentials in your repository and how to prevent them from being exposed on GitHub in future pushes.
- **Prerequisites**: Basics of git and GitHub functionality. We recommend you complete [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github).
- **How long**: This course takes less than 15 minutes to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Enable secret protection
2. Identify secrets stored in your repository
3. Enable push protection
4. Stop secrets from being written to your repository

- Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.

- If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! 🐛
