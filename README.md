# Introduction to secret scanning

_GitHub scans repositories for known types of secrets, such as API keys and authentication tokens, to prevent fraudulent use of secrets that were committed accidentally. In this GitHub Skills course you will learn how to enable secret scanning to identify secrets and prevent them from being committed to your repository._

## Welcome

Plain-text credentials accidentally stored in repositories on GitHub are a common target for attackers.  In fact, we find well over a million tokens stored on the GitHub platform each year. Secret scanning is a powerful tool which allows teams to identify these plain-text credentials, remove them, and create rules to prevent them from being written to GitHub in the first place.

Secret scanning is available for free for public repositories on all plans. Enterprises that need secret scanning capabilities for private repositories should review [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security). GitHub Advanced Security allows you to use secret scanning and other security features on private and internal repositories.

- **Who is this for**: Developers, DevOps Engineers, security teams.
- **What you'll learn**: How to identify plain-text credentials in your repository and how to prevent them from being exposed on GitHub in future pushes.
- **Prerequisites**: Basics of git and GitHub functionality. We recommend you complete [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github).
- **How long**: This course takes less than 15 minutes to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Enable secret scanning
2. Identify secrets stored in your repository
